  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of
      the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of
      the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
      While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
      fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at
      some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

    <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were Dwarvern brothers and were also the youngest of the
      thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with
      Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon
      Smaug. Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company,
      and, apart from Balin and possibly Bombur, they appear more frequently as
      "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest of
      Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin
      fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in
      TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that
      Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and
      his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and
      survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely
      Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
      company of Thorin.

    <p>
      Glóin, son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's
      company who set out to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor.
      He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of
      the Ring. Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character.
      Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring during the Council of
      Elrond.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin.
      He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield
      on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord known for his
      wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
      friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant
      of the noble House of Durin. He later went to re-establish the Dwarf
      presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by
      Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
